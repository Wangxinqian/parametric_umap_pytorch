Introduction
----------

This is a simple reproduce of ParametricUMAP based on PyTorch.
I mainly took two sorces for reference, 
[umap library source code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) and [parametric_umap tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WkXVZ5pnMrm17m0YgmtoNjM_XHdnE5Vp?usp=sharing#scrollTo=qxcSof65XWKM).
